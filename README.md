# Thyroid-Disease-Prediction-System

These files generate a portal, a desktop application in python using ‘tkinter’ library. On running the code, we get a portal where we have to enter all the details of the user and system runs the algorithm behind and gives us an output based on the training set dataset that the user will be having thyroid in his/her future or not.

The user is required to enter the required information to the system. This information will be available in the reports of the tests performed by the user. The system will ask the user to enter the required information and on the basis of the information entered by the user the system will predict whether the user will have thyroid or will not have thyroid.
